        Dear customer, here is the invoice for your winter storage space. You can pay it by
        clicking the ‘make your payment’ button below in this message.
      </p>
      <p>
        After receiving your payment, we will send you a winter storage sticker that must
        be attached to the boat in a visible spot. We will inspect the payment situation of
        boats taken to winter storage areas. An additional payment may be imposed on any
        boats found without a sticker.
      </p>
